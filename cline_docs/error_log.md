### Error: Argon Dashboard Django template files not found in expected location

#### Description:
During the implementation of the Argon Dashboard Django template, it was discovered that the template files were not in the expected location. This led to a change in approach for integrating the template into the project.

#### Impact:
- Unable to follow standard installation process for Argon Dashboard Django
- Need to adapt the integration process using existing files in apps/static/assets directory

#### Resolution Steps:
1. Identified existing Argon Dashboard template files in apps/static/assets directory
2. Updated settings.py to include necessary configurations for template usage
3. Modified main urls.py to include Argon Dashboard URLs
4. Planned to update existing templates and views to work with Argon Dashboard layout

#### Lessons Learned:
- Always verify the presence and location of third-party template files before beginning integration
- Be prepared to adapt the integration approach based on the actual project structure
- Regularly check and update project documentation to reflect the current state and any deviations from expected processes

## Custom Error Pages

Custom error pages have been implemented to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience during error scenarios within the dashboard. These pages are integrated with the navigation templates to ensure seamless transitions and accessibility.

#### Next Steps:
- Continue with the integration process using the existing template files
- Thoroughly test the frontend after integration to ensure proper functionality
- Update project documentation to reflect the adapted approach for future reference
