# Current Task

## Objective
Implement the Argon Dashboard Django template for the frontend and set up the initial database with SQLite

## Context
We are developing a stock analysis platform as a graduation project. We'll use SQLite for initial development and testing, then migrate to PostgreSQL later.

## Next Steps
1. Update settings.py to include necessary configurations for the Argon Dashboard template and SQLite database
2. Update the project's main urls.py file to include Argon Dashboard URLs
3. Ensure the apps/home directory exists and contains necessary views and URL configurations
4. Update existing templates to extend the Argon Dashboard base template
5. Adjust views to render the appropriate Argon Dashboard templates
6. Verify template inheritance to avoid confusion with multiple `base.html` files
7. Ensure that all referenced templates exist
8. Set up initial models using SQLite database
9. Test the frontend to ensure proper rendering and functionality

## Security and Import Enhancements
- Move sensitive settings to environment variables
- Review the predictions app models to resolve ImportError
- [ ] Develop a stock analysis and prediction application

## Notes
- Template files are now being served from the apps/static/assets directory
- Template HTML files are expected to be in the apps/templates directory
- Maintain existing functionality while implementing the new template
- Regularly test the server and functionality throughout the integration process
- We will use SQLite for initial development and testing

### Completed Tasks
- Implemented custom error pages to enhance user experience.
- Added navigation templates for dashboard integration

## Progress
- [x] Identified the location of existing Argon Dashboard template files
- [x] Updated settings.py with necessary configurations
- [x] Updated main urls.py to include Argon Dashboard URLs
- [ ] Set up initial database with SQLite
- [ ] Verify Frontend-Backend communication and integration

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring proper integration of existing template files with the project structure
- Adapting views and templates to work with the Argon Dashboard layout
- Setting up initial models with SQLite database

## Future Plans
- Transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL after initial development and testing
