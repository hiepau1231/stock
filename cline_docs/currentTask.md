# Current Task

## Objective
Implement the Argon Dashboard Django template for the frontend, set up the initial database with SQLite, and integrate web scraping for real-time stock data.

## Context
We are developing a stock analysis platform as a graduation project. We'll use SQLite for initial development and testing, then migrate to PostgreSQL later. We will also implement web scraping to gather real-time stock data.

## Next Steps
1. Update settings.py to include necessary configurations for the Argon Dashboard template and SQLite database
2. Update the project's main urls.py file to include Argon Dashboard URLs
3. Ensure the apps/home directory exists and contains necessary views and URL configurations
4. Update existing templates to extend the Argon Dashboard base template
5. Adjust views to render the appropriate Argon Dashboard templates
6. Verify template inheritance to avoid confusion with multiple `base.html` files
7. Ensure that all referenced templates exist
8. Set up initial models using SQLite database
9. Implement web scraping functionality for real-time stock data:
   - Set up Selenium WebDriver with Chrome in headless mode
   - Create a script to scrape stock data from the specified website
   - Process and clean the scraped data
   - Store the scraped data in the SQLite database
10. Test the frontend to ensure proper rendering and functionality
11. Test the web scraping functionality and data storage

## Security and Import Enhancements
- Move sensitive settings to environment variables
- Review the predictions app models to resolve ImportError
- [ ] Develop a stock analysis and prediction application
- Ensure secure handling of web scraping tools and data

## Notes
- Template files are now being served from the apps/static/assets directory
- Template HTML files are expected to be in the apps/templates directory
- Maintain existing functionality while implementing the new template
- Regularly test the server and functionality throughout the integration process
- We will use SQLite for initial development and testing
- Web scraping will be used to gather real-time stock data

### Completed Tasks
- Implemented custom error pages to enhance user experience
- Added navigation templates for dashboard integration
✅ Set up initial project structure
✅ Configured Django settings for the project
✅ Integrated Argon Dashboard template
✅ Set up authentication system
✅ Fixed URL routing issues
✅ Successfully logged in with superuser account

## Progress
- [x] Identified the location of existing Argon Dashboard template files
- [x] Updated settings.py with necessary configurations
- [x] Updated main urls.py to include Argon Dashboard URLs
- [ ] Set up initial database with SQLite
- [x] Created initial web scraping script (stored in apps/stock_analysis/web_scraping_script.py)
- [ ] Implement web scraping functionality
- [ ] Verify Frontend-Backend communication and integration

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring proper integration of existing template files with the project structure
- Adapting views and templates to work with the Argon Dashboard layout
- Setting up initial models with SQLite database
- Implementing efficient and reliable web scraping for real-time stock data
- Handling potential issues with web scraping (e.g., rate limiting, changes in website structure)

## Future Plans
- Transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL after initial development and testing
- Optimize web scraping process for better performance and reliability
- Implement data validation and error handling for scraped data

## Current Focus
Developing the core stock analysis functionality, starting with creating models for stock data.

## Challenges
- Ensuring accurate and timely data retrieval through web scraping
- Implementing effective prediction algorithms
- Optimizing performance for large datasets

## Notes
- Regularly commit changes to version control
- Keep security in mind, especially when handling user data and API keys
