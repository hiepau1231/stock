# Current Task

## Objective
Implement the Argon Dashboard Django template for the frontend

## Context
The Argon Dashboard Django template files were not found in the expected location. We need to adapt our approach and use the existing template files in the apps/static/assets directory to integrate the Argon Dashboard into our project.

## Next Steps
1. Update settings.py to include necessary configurations for the Argon Dashboard template
2. Update the project's main urls.py file to include Argon Dashboard URLs
3. Ensure the apps/home directory exists and contains necessary views and URL configurations
4. Update existing templates to extend the Argon Dashboard base template
5. Adjust views to render the appropriate Argon Dashboard templates
6. Test the frontend to ensure proper rendering and functionality
