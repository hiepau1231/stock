# Current Task

## Objective
Implement the Argon Dashboard Django template for the frontend

## Context
The Argon Dashboard Django template files were not found in the expected location. We need to adapt our approach and use the existing template files in the apps/static/assets directory to integrate the Argon Dashboard into our project.

## Next Steps
1. Update settings.py to include necessary configurations for the Argon Dashboard template
2. Update the project's main urls.py file to include Argon Dashboard URLs
3. Ensure the apps/home directory exists and contains necessary views and URL configurations
4. Update existing templates to extend the Argon Dashboard base template
5. Adjust views to render the appropriate Argon Dashboard templates
6. Verify template inheritance to avoid confusion with multiple `base.html` files
7. Ensure that all referenced templates exist
8. Test the frontend to ensure proper rendering and functionality

## Security and Import Enhancements
- Move sensitive settings to environment variables
- Restrict CORS settings for production
- Review the predictions app models to resolve ImportError
- [ ] Develop a stock analysis and prediction application

## Notes
- Template files are now being served from the apps/static/assets directory
- Template HTML files are expected to be in the apps/templates directory
- Maintain existing functionality while implementing the new template
- Regularly test the server and functionality throughout the integration process

### Completed Tasks
- Implemented custom error pages to enhance user experience.
- Added navigation templates for dashboard integration

## Progress
- [x] Identified the location of existing Argon Dashboard template files
- [x] Updated settings.py with necessary configurations
- [x] Updated main urls.py to include Argon Dashboard URLs
- [ ] Begin transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Verify Frontend-Backend communication and integration

## Current Challenges
