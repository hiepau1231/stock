# Codebase Summary

## Key Components and Their Interactions
1. Django Backend
   - Main project: stock_analysis_project
   - Apps:
     - authentication: Handles user authentication with a custom User model
     - mock_api: Provides mock API endpoints
     - predictions: Manages stock predictions
     - real_time_services: Handles real-time data services using Django Channels
     - stock_analysis: Core stock analysis functionality

2. Frontend (React inferred)
   - Located in the 'frontend' directory
   - Uses webpack for bundling
   - Communicates with backend through REST API and WebSockets

## Data Flow
- RESTful API communication between frontend and backend
- Real-time updates using WebSockets (Django Channels)
- Authentication using token-based system

## External Dependencies
- Django and its related packages (including Channels and REST Framework)
- React (inferred) and its related packages
- CORS Headers for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt and package.json

## Database Configuration
- Currently using SQLite for development
- PostgreSQL configuration available for potential production use

## Recent Significant Changes
- Initial project setup completed
- Django Channels integrated for real-time functionality
- Custom User model implemented for authentication
- CORS configuration added for development

## User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development
- No user feedback integrated yet as the project seems to be in its initial stages

## Current Issues
- ImportError when trying to import 'YourModelName' from 'apps.predictions.models'
- This error suggests that the model structure in the predictions app needs to be reviewed and possibly updated

## Security Considerations
- Debug mode is currently set to True (should be changed for production)
- Secret key is hardcoded in settings.py (should be moved to environment variables)
- CORS is currently allowing all origins (should be restricted in production)

Note: This summary will be updated as we explore and modify the codebase further.
